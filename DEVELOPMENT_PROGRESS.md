# Document Q&A System - Development Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the development progress of the Document Q&A System, a system that allows users to ask questions about their documents and get accurate answers based on the document content.

## Components Implemented

### 1. MCP Server Layer

- [x] MCP Server implementation (`src/mcp/server.ts`)
- [x] Tool registry (`src/mcp/tools/index.ts`)
- [x] Utility functions (`src/mcp/utils/mcp-helpers.ts`)
- [x] Type definitions (`src/mcp/types/mcp-types.ts`)

### 2. MCP Tools

- [x] Google Drive tools
  - [x] `google_drive_list_files` - List files in Google Drive
  - [x] `google_drive_download_file` - Download specific file
- [x] Document processing tools
  - [x] `document_chunk_and_embed` - Process and embed document
- [x] Vector search tools
  - [x] `vector_similarity_search` - Search similar chunks
- [x] Document Q&A tools
  - [x] `document_qa_query` - Answer questions about documents

### 3. Core Services (To be implemented)

- [ ] API Layer
  - [ ] Express.js server
  - [ ] API routes
  - [ ] Controllers
  - [ ] Middleware
- [ ] Frontend
  - [ ] Next.js application
  - [ ] UI components
  - [ ] API integration

## Current Status

The MCP server layer and tools have been implemented. These components provide the core functionality for the Document Q&A System:

1. **Google Drive Integration**: The system can list and download files from Google Drive.
2. **Document Processing**: Documents can be chunked and embedded for vector search.
3. **Vector Search**: The system can search for relevant document chunks based on a query.
4. **Document Q&A**: The system can answer questions about documents using vector search and LLM.

### Project Setup

The following project setup files have been created:

1. **package.json**: Defines project dependencies and scripts.
2. **.env.example**: Example environment variables file.
3. **.env**: Development environment variables.
4. **.gitignore**: Defines files and directories to exclude from version control.
5. **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration.

## Next Steps

1. **API Layer**: Implement the Express.js API layer to provide a RESTful interface for the frontend.
   - Create API routes for document management
   - Create API routes for Q&A interactions
   - Create API routes for Google Drive synchronization
   - Implement authentication and authorization

2. **Frontend**: Implement the Next.js frontend to provide a user interface for the system.
   - Create UI components for document management
   - Create UI components for Q&A interactions
   - Create UI components for Google Drive integration
   - Implement authentication and authorization UI

3. **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests for the system.
   - Write unit tests for core services
   - Write integration tests for API endpoints
   - Write end-to-end tests for the complete system

4. **Deployment**: Set up deployment infrastructure for the system.
   - Create Docker configuration
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure production environment

## Known Issues

1. TypeScript errors in some files due to strict type checking. These will be addressed in future updates.
2. Mock implementations for vector search and LLM generation. These will be replaced with actual implementations in future updates.

## Notes

- The system is currently using mock implementations for vector search and LLM generation. These will be replaced with actual implementations in future updates.
- The Google Drive integration requires OAuth2 authentication. The system provides functions to generate authentication URLs and exchange authorization codes for tokens.
- The document processing pipeline includes chunking and embedding. The chunking strategy preserves sentence boundaries and allows for overlap between chunks.
